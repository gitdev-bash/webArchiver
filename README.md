# webArchiver
webArchiver is a project in alpha with the main purpose of Archiving Websites but can be used to archived anything.   
It saves space by dealing with duplicates, keeps all files in a central location and keeps logs.   
#### Other new functions like CGI web interfaces, automatic archiving of websites and other terminal functions are coming!   
Being in alpha you might see python error messages in edge cases: different devices, broken names, wrong CSV files.   
If you encounter a bug or misspelling please report it at https://github.com/gitdev-bash/webArchiver/issues.   
All contributions are welcome.
